:py:mod:`medusa.recon.flame.deca.encoders`
==========================================

.. py:module:: medusa.recon.flame.deca.encoders

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Encoders specific to DECA-based reconstruction models.

   For the associated license, see license.md.



Module Contents
---------------

.. py:class:: ResNet(block, layers)



   ResNet-based encoder for DECA/EMOCA.

   .. py:method:: forward(x)



.. py:class:: Bottleneck(inplanes, planes, stride=1, downsample=None)



   Base class for all neural network modules.

   Your models should also subclass this class.

   Modules can also contain other Modules, allowing to nest them in
   a tree structure. You can assign the submodules as regular attributes::

       import torch.nn as nn
       import torch.nn.functional as F

       class Model(nn.Module):
           def __init__(self):
               super().__init__()
               self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 20, 5)
               self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(20, 20, 5)

           def forward(self, x):
               x = F.relu(self.conv1(x))
               return F.relu(self.conv2(x))

   Submodules assigned in this way will be registered, and will have their
   parameters converted too when you call :meth:`to`, etc.

   .. note::
       As per the example above, an ``__init__()`` call to the parent class
       must be made before assignment on the child.

   :ivar training: Boolean represents whether this module is in training or
                   evaluation mode.
   :vartype training: bool

   .. py:attribute:: expansion
      :value: 4

      

   .. py:method:: forward(x)



.. py:function:: conv3x3(in_planes, out_planes, stride=1)

   3x3 convolution with padding.


.. py:class:: BasicBlock(inplanes, planes, stride=1, downsample=None)
