Medusa is a Python toolbox to perform 4D face reconstruction and analysis. You can use it to reconstruct a series of 3D meshes of (moving) faces from video files: one 3D mesh for each frame of the video (resulting in a "4D" representation of facial movement). In
addition to functionality to reconstruct faces, Medusa also contains functionality to preprocess and analyze the resulting 4D reconstructions.
