Medusa is a Python toolbox to perform 4D face reconstruction and analysis. You can use it
to reconstruct a series of 3D meshes of (moving) faces from video files: one 3D mesh for
each frame of the video (resulting in a "4D" representation of facial movement). In
addition to functionality to reconstruct faces, Medusa also contains functionality to
preprocess and analyze the resulting 4D reconstructions.

For information on how to install and use Medusa, check out the
