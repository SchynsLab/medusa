# Command-line interface

The command line interface can be used to preprocess video data step by step. The first step, reconstruction of the video frames into 3D meshes, assumes the following directory structure:

```
data
└── sub-01
    ├── sub-01_task-mini_events.tsv
    ├── sub-01_task-mini_frametimes.tsv
    └── sub-01_task-mini.mp4
```

where `data` is the toplevel directory, which contains one or more subject-level directories (e.g., `sub-01`). Each subject directory contains at least a video file (for now, only `mp4` files are allowed) ending in `_video.mp4` and a "frame times" file ending in `_frametimes.tsv`. This tabular file (with tab separators) should contain a column named `t` which contains, for every frame in the video, the time in seconds of the acquisition of the frame. The file ending in `_events.tsv` is not strictly necessary for preprocessing, but is needed for the analysis phase.
