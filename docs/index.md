Medusa is Python toolbox for face image and video analysis. It offers tools for face
detection, alignment, rendering, and most importantly, *4D reconstruction*.
Using state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction models, Medusa can track and reconstruct faces
in videos (one 3D mesh per face, per frame) and thus provide a way to automatically
measure and quantify face movement as 4D signals. For an overview of the package and the
underlying methods, check out the video below.

## Documentation overview

On this website, you can find general information about Medusa (such as how to
[install](getting_started/installation) and [cite](getting_started/citation) it), as
well as details on Medusa's [command-line interface](api/cli) and
[Python interface](api/python).
